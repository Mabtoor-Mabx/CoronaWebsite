The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 11 July 2020, more than 12.5 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 560,000 deaths; more than 6.89 million people have recovered.

			Background
		</h1>
		<p class="tet">
			On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) got reports from health authorities in China of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020. On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.

Several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin. The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin. The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market. On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.

The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly surpassed China's.
